# Python LAB Project

This repository contains a collection of mini Python projects completed as part of my python learning journey on cisco networking academy. Each folder within this repo represents a separate project with its own focus, code, and README documentation.

## Projects

### 1. [Lab Military Timer](./lab_military_timer/)
A timer application built in Python that simulates a military-style countdown and timing mechanism.

### 2. [Weeker - Day of Week Calculator](./weeker_project/)
A Python class that allows manipulation of weekdays by adding or subtracting a given number of days, including custom exception handling.

## Purpose

These lab projects help reinforce key Python concepts including:
- Class creation and object-oriented programming
- Exception handling
- Encapsulation and modular code structure
- Command-line interaction

## More Projects Coming Soon!

This repository will continue to grow as I complete more tasks and projects from my learning platform.

Feel free to explore each folder to view the source code and specific instructions.
